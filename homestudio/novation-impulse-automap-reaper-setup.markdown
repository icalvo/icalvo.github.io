## Downloads
Go to Novation and download USB Driver and Automap. While on it, download also the keyboard User Guide and read it carefully at some point!

## USB Driver installation
Choose MIDI Only unless you also have some other Novation audio hardware that requires ASIO, in that case choose All.

## Automap installation
Next, Next,... , OK. Straightforward.

## Automap configuration


## Automap Smart Folder

Reaper has a nice feature, Smart Folders, that allows you to see only Automap-enabled plugins automatically. To set it up:

1. Open any FX chain and Add a new FX. This will show the "Add FX to" window with all the plugins.
2. Right-click on "Folders" or any folder under it and choose "Add folder" from the contextual menu.
3. Fill the "Name" textbox e.g. with "Automap" or "Automap Plugins".
3. Click the "Smart folder" checkbox and fill the "Filter" field with "(Automap)".
4. Click "OK".

This Smart Folder will automatically populate with the Automap versions of your plugins every time you start REAPER or scan for new plugins.
