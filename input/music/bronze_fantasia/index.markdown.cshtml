On September 2008, I was contacted by a trumpetist called Michael (Mic) Smith, from Miami, FL. He had just recorded an album for trumpet quintet called ["Trumpets Alone"](https://open.spotify.com/album/2PsdTzxXQTYMoCBWW5FCC8), in which he wanted to include an arrangement of one of my pieces, ["Andean"](/music/works/andean), made by Jay Lichtmann. Unfortunately he wasn't able to do so before contacting me to ask for permission.

So he wanted to record a second album for trumpet quintet, in which he would include a number of original commissions, including the "Andean" arrangement. He also offered me to include any other arrangement, to which I responded that I would rather compose a dedicated composition. And thus was born this work, "Bronze Fantasia". I started some failed sketches during the first months of 2009, but I couldn't find the inspiration until the summer of 2009. Between July and September I composed the whole piece.

Unfortunately, personal circumstances made it impossible for Mic to record that second album. On the other hand, he recorded some very good quality mock-ups of the piece, so that I could check them and review the score. You can listen to them here.

The piece starts with a kind of gallant dance phrase and develops it through the first part of the piece. In the second (slow) part I featured an inversion of that phrase, and after writing some of the fast-paced third part I realized that that inversion was very similar to a traditional Spanish theme called "Ant√≥n Pirulero"; so I decided to structure the last part around a final, climactic exposition of that theme.
