Another quick note, this time on TFS + git. When you queue a manual build you can specify what commit you want in a number of ways, using the "Checkout override" option. You can specify either a commit ID, a tag or a branch.

For the commit you paste the SHA-1, or a significant part of it, just as you do with the command line.

For the tag you just use the tag name.

For the branch you use the branch name, but there's a silly trick that drove me nuts until [jessehouwing](http://stackoverflow.com/users/736079/jessehouwing) [pointed it out for me](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21409192/queue-build-for-non-default-branch-with-git-and-vs/21409699?noredirect=1#comment45059423_21409699): you must prepend `origin/` to your branch name.
