A pretty basic Powershell command that everyone uses to list environment variables is:

```powershell
ls env:
```
<!--more-->
A few caveats here: this is NOT going to work in Linux or MacOS because in those environments the alias `ls` is not defined[^1]. Therefore the safest bet is to use `Get-ChildItem` instead.

Also, this is shown in table format (which is nice), but it truncates long values (which is not nice with variables like `PATH`):

In order to avoid that we can re-format the output in this way:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem env: | Format-Table -Wrap
```

This will show a long value like this:

Finally, if you miss the classical format you get from Linux `env` or Windows CMD `set`, you can do the following:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem env: | % { "$($_.Name)=$($_.Value)" }
```

It shows like this:
