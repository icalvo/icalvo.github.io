Since I've [started using Sibelius+Noteperformer]({% post_url /studiodiary/2020-11-01-purchased-noteperformer %}), I've been working on rearranging and making decent score editions of my past works, before moving on and composing new things. It's still work in progress but I've made some advances.

I've created a new page with the [complete list of my works](/music/). Right new all the music work pages are a bit empty, except for the first one I added: the [Waltz Miniature, Op.1](/music/works/waltz_miniature/). Please check the piece out!
