## Introduction

This is the Mandelbrot Set, also known as $M$:

![Mandelbrot set](@Raw(InputFileSystem.Input.Pages.Mandelbrot.MSet_bmp.RelUrl()))

It doesn't look very impressive, but let me tell you we will find places of breathtaking beauty when we set ourselves to explore its limits.

## M-Set construction

This is an atlas, meaning that it will give you clues about how can you find your way around the corners of the M, and also will offer a nice set of pleasant images for your enjoyment.

However, I would like to briefly mention how this object is constructed. This will be the only place where we use maths on this book, but it is for a good reason.

The M-Set is a mathematical object. Specifically, it is a set of points in a 2D plane, specifically the complex plane. The surprising thing is that all the beauty we have peeked at is generated by a surprisingly simple recursive formula:

$$
\begin{equation}
z_{n+1} \leftarrow z^2 + c
\end{equation}
$$
