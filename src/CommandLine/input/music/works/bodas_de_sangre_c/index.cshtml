This is an arrangement for voice and piano of the 4 songs that featured in the [incidental music I composed](/music/works/bodas_de_sangre_a) for Lorca's play _"Bodas de Sangre"_.

In addition to that, it features a new fifth song, _"La oscura raíz del grito"_ ("The dark root of the scream"), with the latest verses of the play.

This piece was a Christmas gift for my stepmother, [Maristela Gruber](https://maristelagruber.com/). The downside is that it was 2015 when I gifted it to her, meaning that it took me 3 years to finish the job! Bad performance, no question... but here it is, at last!
