    This is one of the first symphonic pieces where I develop a single theme in a more coherent way. It's an energetic piece with a marked rhythm based on the alternation and combination of 3/4 and 6/8. In the middle, though, there is a slow section where the themes are developed in a more lyrical and quiet way.
