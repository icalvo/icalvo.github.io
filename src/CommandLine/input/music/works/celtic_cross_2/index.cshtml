I started this piece inspired by the good results of ["Celtic cross"](/music/works/celtic_cross_2) with this particular instrument ensemble of oboe, English horn and harp. Unfortunately, unlike its predecessor, this piece has a decent amount of sudden tonality shifts that made it impossible to perform with a single harp; so in a subsequent review (2021) I introduced a second harp. Now it is fine, although it has a couple of relatively fast pedal changes.
