I found out during September 2018 that the girlfriend one of my work colleagues played in a clarinet ensemble. I contacted them and arranged ["Bronze Fantasia"](/music/works/bronze_fantasia/) for that ensemble. We managed to gather 5 instruments and I arranged the piece for them.

Unfortunately this piece was (to my knowledge) never played, due to further changes in the ensemble administration.
