This is a short piece for woodwind piano quartet. "Dulce" is Spanish for "sweet", and this is indeed a soft and peaceful symmetrical set of variations that only gets disturbed by a mild minor-key agitation in the middle.

The date of composition is July 1998, but this piece was actually composed earlier (I guess it was around 1994) with an ancient software called [Adlib Visual Composer](https://archive.org/details/AdLibVisualComposerV1.51). I remember working on this piece with a sequencer which name I cannot recall (probably it was able to cope with Visual Composer format). It worked with some kind of soundfonts, instead of FM synthesis. Shortly after I moved to Cakewalk (probably on 1994-1995).

In 1998 I reworked the composition, and it is this last revision that was edited.
