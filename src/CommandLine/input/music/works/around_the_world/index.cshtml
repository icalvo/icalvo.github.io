An old piece, which is just a collection of fairly disconnected themes. Some of them are pretty decent, though, and I think that the final reprise is quite thrilling. It was originally conceived for oboe, English horn and harp. However, this was before I knew better about the capabilities of the harp. The piece would certainly need at least two harps if I wanted to keep that sound. I thought it was more practical and realistic to arrange for piano, so that's the current instrumentation.
