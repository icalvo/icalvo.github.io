In 1998 we enrolled in what probably was the most ambitious project of Barbara Otto Schneider as stage director of the theatrical group (Grupo Pentagrama) of Ramiro de Maeztu Secondary School: Seneca's Medea. She did previously work on an innovative translation to Spanish of the original Latin work and she wanted to bring it to the stage.

After my past collaborations with [Bodas de Sangre](/music/works/bodas_de_sangre_a/) and [Octavia](/music/works/octavia/), Barbara wanted to count on me again for the incidental music of this play.
