The purpose of SWGen is to have a static website generator where both the metadata and the front-end generation logic is written in a typed language like C#.

Therefore we use Razor as the templating engine, where you can have autocompletion and full C# power. The templates themselves can define its own front matter and the metadata is also written in C#.
