This is the complete list of my original complete compositions. You can **click on each of the work titles to get more details** about that work, as well as several downloadable files that can include a PDF with the full score & parts, audio files, and MIDI files.

All the pieces are licensed under a **Creative Commons Attribution License**. This means that you are free to use the audio files and the scores, as long as you credit me as the composer. However, I would be very grateful if you let me know about any use you make of my music. Please contact me (check the footer of this page) in that case, or if you want to commision an original work.

You can **check my musical biography [here]({% link music/biography.markdown %})**.
