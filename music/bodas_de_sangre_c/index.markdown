This is an arrangement for voice and piano of the 4 songs that featured in the [incidental music I composed](../bodas_de_sangre_a/) for Lorca's play _"Bodas de Sangre"_.

In addition to that, it features a new fifth song, _"La oscura ra√≠z del grito"_ ("The dark root of the scream"), with the latest verses of the play.
