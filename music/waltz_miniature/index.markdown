This is a piece I composed when I was 16, with an ancient software called [Adlib Visual Composer](https://archive.org/details/AdLibVisualComposerV1.51). On January 2021 I reviewed some of these old works. They were all pretty disposable, but I thought this one deserved to be resurrected, so I decided to arrange it for orchestra.

For archaeological purposes, you can listen the original piece, which was recorded in a cassette and converted later to a digital format (so the quality is very low).
