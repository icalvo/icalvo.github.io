This is a piece I composed when I was 16, with an ancient software called Adlib Visual Composer. Some days ago I reviewed some of these old works. They were pretty basic but I thought this one deserved something better, so I decided to arrange it for orchestra.

For archaeological purposes, you can listen the original piece, which was recorded in a cassette and converted much later to a file.
