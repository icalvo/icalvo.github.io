I started studying alto saxophone in 2016. After two years, I proposed my teachers to play an arrangement of ["Bronze Fantasia"]({% link music/bronze_fantasia/index.markdown %}). We managed to gather 5 instruments and I arranged the piece for them.

We played the arrangement on June 1st 2018.

The arrangement has pretty much the same music as the original piece; however, due to the different restrictions of the instruments, I made a different modulation at the second part and thus the third part is played in a different key.
