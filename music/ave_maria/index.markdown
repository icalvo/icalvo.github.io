I composed this Ave Maria to be performed on my wedding. My stepmother, [Maristela Gruber](https://maristelagruber.com/), gifted me with the music performance for the ceremony and the celebration, and brought a small choir and a pianist (which played the church organ). I took the chance to compose this piece and a negro spiritual (["The wife of noble character"]({% link music/the_wife_of_noble_character/index.markdown %})).
