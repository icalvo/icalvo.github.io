In 1998 we enroled in what probably was the most ambitious project of Barbara Otto Schneider as stage director of the theatrical group (Grupo Pentagrama) of Ramiro de Maeztu Secondary School: Seneca's Medea. She did previously work on an innovative translation to Spanish of the original Latin work and she wanted to bring it to the stage.

After my past collaborations with Bodas de Sangre and [Octavia](../octavia/), Barbara wanted to count on me again for the incidental music of this play.
