I was born in Madrid, where I undertook musical studies in Adagio Academy and [Música Creativa](https://musicacreativa.com/), where I also attented courses of Orchestration and Composition for Short Film, taught by [Alejandro Román](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Rom%C3%A1n).

Between 1997 and 1999 I composed the music (songs, dances and incidental) for three Grupo Pentagrama's plays: [Bodas de Sangre]({% link music/bodas_de_sangre_a/index.markdown %}), [Octavia]({% link music/octavia/index.markdown %}), and [Medea]({% link music/medea/index.markdown %}). In 1998 I was awarded with the First Prize for the "IV Certamen de Teatro Escolar" (4th School Theatre Competition), organized by the Madrid Autonomous Community.

Between 1997 and 1998 I received the First Prize at the "Synth Music Competition", organized by the IDIM Assotiation of the Computer Science Faculty at UPM (Politechnic University of Madrid).

In 2003 I made the arrangements and conducted the orchestra for the Tubular Project, a version of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells for the [Mandolin Orchestra "Vicente Aleixandre"](https://es-la.facebook.com/ovaaranjuez/) of Aranjuez. It was premiered in 2003 at Aranjuez, with the collaboration of [David Bedford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bedford), and performed 6 times between 2003 and 2006, at Aranjuez, Alcázar de San Juan and Amurrio.
