On September 2008, I was contacted by a trumpetist called Michael (Mic) Smith, from Miami, FL. He had just recorded an album for trumpet quintet called ["Trumpets Alone"](https://open.spotify.com/album/2PsdTzxXQTYMoCBWW5FCC8), in which he wanted to include an arrangement of one of my pieces, ["Andean"]({% link music/andean/index.markdown %}), made by Jay Lichtmann. Unfortunately he wasn't able to do so before contacting me to ask for permission.

So he wanted to record a second album for trumpet quintet, in which he would include a number of original commissions, including the "Andean" arrangement. He also offered me to include any other arrangement, to which I responded that I would rather compose a dedicated composition. And thus was born this work, "Bronze Fantasia".

I started with a kind of gallant dance phrase and developed it through the first part of the piece. In the second (slow) part I featured an inversion of that phrase, and after writing some of the fast-paced last part I realized that that inversion was very similar to a traditional Spanish theme called "Ant√≥n Pirulero"; so I decided to structure the last part around a final, climactic exposition of that theme.
