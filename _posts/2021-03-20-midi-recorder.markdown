I've just released a command line utility to record MIDI activity and save it into files. The files are split by some delay without MIDI activity. You can have this tool running in the background and it will quietly save all those improvisations that are usually lost and that you cannot remember well afterwards!

Please go to [MIDI Recorder site](https://github.com/MidiRecorder/MidiRecorder/) for more information and downloads.
