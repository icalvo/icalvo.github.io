I've purchased [NotePerfomer 3](https://www.noteperformer.com/), which is a playback engine for notation software (Sibelius, Finale and Dorico). I think it's an absolutely extraordinary product.

I can forget about sample libraries, controllers, keyswitches, and simply write notes in a staff. It still doesn't reach the quality of a handcrafted arrangement with a DAW, but there's no reason to think it cannot get there at some point. It is my belief that automating as much as possible all the nitty-gritty details of virtual instrument arrangement is the way to go.

And the price tag is awesome as well!
